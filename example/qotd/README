This example is based on the QOTD example from the book Grails in Action.
It has been modified where necessary to work within this framework and with ColdFusion.
You will need to set up a datasource named qotd in order for this to work.
I'm currently looking for ways to auto create the datasource if it doesn't exist.  
I would also like to figure out how to create a derby database on the RAM drive ColdFusion provides,
but this doesn't seem possible.
